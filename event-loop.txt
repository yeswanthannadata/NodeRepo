Event Loop
----------
-> JS is a single-threaded non-blocking asynchronous concurrent language
-> It have a call stack, and event loops, a callback queue and some other apis and stuff
-> v8 has a call stack and a heap

call stack == one threaded == one thing at a time

event loop role is to look in to the call stack and task queue, if stack is empty, fetch from queue and execute it

browser will do re-paints every few milli-seconds. if there is something in stack, it will not render
once stack is cleared, render will continue re-renders even in between callback queues
at the time of callback queue pushed to stack it pauses again and then resumes again once call stack is cleared
render queue will have high priority over callback queue
